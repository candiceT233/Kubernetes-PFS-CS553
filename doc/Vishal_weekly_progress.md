For this week: 

We started on the Chameleon cloud and created 2 node cluster of Kubernetes. 

From the dynamic volume provisioning, we have observed that it provisions volumes from the NFS. ( Yet to implement this on cloud ) 

Coming to Beegfs we are working on the installation for the Chameleon Ubuntu instances. 

In pipeline: 

We are yet to work on Beegfs for the chameleon and my question is we will be using the same volume NFS servers.
